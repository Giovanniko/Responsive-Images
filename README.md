# Responsive-Images-Tables: Naples News

Final version of responsive design project Brighton News, which I renamed "Naples News", from Udacity's Front-end Dev. Course.

This was my first responsive web page project. It illustrates the use of media queries in the external stylesheet to reformat the page for different screen sizes. Text and images took on different sizes at various major and minor breakpoints. As the screen sizes got smaller certain elements moved position and resized as needed. I also took the table from a landscape layout to a more vertical design for the smaller screen widths. There was also the additional challenge of formatting text to ellipse once the text box became too small. The disappearing nav bar and reformatting of the table were the more advanced features that are illustrated in the project.
