# Responsive-Images-Tables: Brighton-News

Final version of responsive design project Brighton News from Udacity's Front-end Dev. Course.

This was my first responsive web page project. It illustrates the use of media queries in the css file to change various formats. Text and images took on different sizes at various major and minor breakpoints. There was also the additional challenge of formatting text to ellipse once the text box became too small. The disappearing nav bar and reformatting of the table were the more advanced features.
